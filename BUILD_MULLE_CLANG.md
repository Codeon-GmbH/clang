# How to build mulle-clang

## What you get

* `mulle-clang` the mulle-clang the binary in `/usr/local/bin`.


### Prerequisites

You need a fairly current Unix, like Linux, OS X or FreeBSD. Or you can use
[MINGW](http://mingw.org/) on Windows.

Locate a place on your filesystem, where you have at least 8 GB disk space free 
after installing all pre-requisites. You probably need not bother to try, if 
you have less than 6 GB of RAM. Or you risk seeing 
`virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory`.

A docker container usually only has 10 GB of space. That may not be enough to build
the compiler!

If you are configuring a virtual machine, give it some more cores!


### Windows: Installing further prerequisites

Check the
[mulle-build README.md](//www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/git/mulle-build/README.md)
for instructions how to get the "Git for Windows" bash going.


### Installing on Linux or FreeBSD

You need the **bash** shell and you may want to get **sudo** happening to
install packages (or run the script as **root**). bash is already present.

Continue with [Common generic instructions](#common-generic).


### Installing on Windows 10

Firstly ensure, that your username does not contain anything else than
characters and underscores.

* mulle_nat : good
* nat : good
* Nat! : bad
* i am nat : very bad

You need to install some prerequisites first.

* Install [Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](//beta.visualstudio.com/downloads/) or better (free). Make sure that you install Windows C++ support. Also add git support.
* [Git for Windows](//git-scm.com/download/win) is included in VS 2015, make sure it's there
* [Python 2 for Windows](//www.python.org/downloads/windows/). **Make sure that python is installed in **PATH**, which is not the default**
* [CMake for Windows](//cmake.org/download/). CMake should also add itself to **PATH**.

Reboot, so that Windows picks up the **PATH** changes (Voodoo).

Now the tricky part is to get the "Git bash" shell running with the proper VS
environment.  Assuming you kept default settings the "Git bash" is
`C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe`. Open the "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2015"
from the start menu and execute the git-bash from there. A second window with
the bash should open.

### Common generic instructions

Build and install using the `install-mulle-clang.sh` script.

The script downloads and builds the compiler and the dependencies. If your
machine is puny and weak, try to get pre-built binary packages from somewhere
as this project is huge.


1. Download the script, don't clone the whole repository yet

   ```
   mkdir mulle-clang
   cd mulle-clang
   curl -L -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codeon-GmbH/mulle-clang/mulle_objclang_40/install-mulle-clang.sh"
   ```
2. Build the compiler. Here is an example, where the compiler is installed into
   `opt` and the symlink to the compiler is installed in `/usr/local/bin`:

   ```
   chmod 755 install-mulle-clang.sh
   ./install-mulle-clang.sh --clang-prefix /opt
   ./install-mulle-clang.sh install --symlink-prefix /usr/local
   ```

   Now you will have to wait for a long, long time.
